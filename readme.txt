Question 1 -
Run: monte_hall.py

Input: Number of simulations (Eg. 1000)
Output: Probabilities for the 3 cases of Monte Hall Problem

Note: It is required that the file custom_random.py be in the same directory as monte_hall.py




Question 2 -
Run: stock_price.py

Input: Number of data points per average to find the moving average (Eg. 10)
Output: 10 graphs of the 10 different trajectories

Note: It is required that the file custom_random.py be in the same directory as stock_price.py




Question 3 -
It is preferred to use IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse or some other similar IDE to compile and run the program.

Compile and Run: Main.java

Input: Grid size (Eg. 100), Number of seeds (Eg. 2000)
Output: OpenGL window that shows the Game of Life

Note: 
OpenGL Java (jogl) .jar files required to run this program are given in a folder. They should be added as external libraries in order to compile the program.




Question 4 -
Run: grain.py

Input: Bin size required to group grains depending on their size range (Eg. 10)
Output: Mean sizes and frequencies of grain distribution in psi_1.dat and psi_2.dat
Graphs of the distribution

Note: It is required that the file custom_random.py, psi_1.dat and psi_2.dat be in the same directory as grain.py
